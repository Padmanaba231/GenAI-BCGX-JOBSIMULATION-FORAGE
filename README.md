# GenAI-BCGX-JOBSIMULATION-FORAGE 💡🤖
This repository contains my submission for the GenAI BCGX Job Simulation on Forage. The project covers the end-to-end data science workflow, starting from finance report scraping 📊 to data analysis 📈 and using Generative AI 🧠 to build a Chatbot model 💬 for information retrieval.

## Project Overview 🌍
BCG GenAI Job Simulation on Forage - January 2025
 * Completed a job simulation involving AI-powered financial chatbot development
   for BCG's GenAI Consulting team.
 * Gained experience in Python programming, including the use of libraries such
   as pandas for data manipulation.
 * Integrated and interpreted complex financial data from 10-K and 10-Q reports,
   employing a chatbot that provides user-friendly
   financial insights and analysis.

The goal of this project was to simulate a real-world data science task for Boston Consulting Group. The workflow includes the following steps:
<br>
  1️⃣ **Data Collection** 📑 : Reading financial reports and collecting necessary data.
<br>
  2️⃣ **Data Analysis** 🔍 : Analyzing data to extract insights and perform necessary feature extraction.
<br>
  3️⃣ **Building Chatbot** 🤖 : Developing a chatbot model using Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental to enhance information retrieval.

## How to Use the APP 🛠️
1️⃣ Get Your API Key 🔑
* Visit the Generative AI website for example Gemini and sign up for access.
* Generate your API key and save it securely.

2️⃣ Set Up Your Environment 🏗️
